# Bubble Sort Read Me

## Description

    https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/bubble-sort/visualize/

    Stable sort
    Time Complexity
        - Best: O(n) linear when array is already sorted.
        - Average: O(n^2) quadratic.
        - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic when the array is reverse sorted.
    Space: O(1) constant.

    For review, create a function that uses BubbleSort to sort an unsorted array in-place.
    For every pair of adjacent indices, swap them if the item on the left is larger than the item on the right until array is fully sorted
    -> Assume there are no duplicates
