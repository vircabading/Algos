# 30 Days of Code: (Day 4) Class vs Instance

# Description

## Objective

In this challenge, we're going to learn about the difference between a class and an instance

## Task

Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter.  The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative.  If a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print 'Age is not valid'.

In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:

```
- If age < 13, print "You are young"
- If age > 13 and age < 18, print "You are a teenager"
- Otherwise print "You are old"
```
