# Permuting Two Arrays Algorithm Read Me

# Description

There are two n-element arrays of integers, A and B. Permute them into some A' and B' such that the relation A'[i] + B'[i] >= k holds for all i where 0 <= i = n.

There will be q queries consisting of A, B, and k. For each query, return YES if some permutation A', B' satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.
