# Zigzag Sequence Algorithm Read Me

# Description

In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.

---------

Given an array of n distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first k elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last k elements are in decreasing order, where k = (n+1)/2. You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.
